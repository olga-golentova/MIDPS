<h3>To Whom It May Concern: </h3>

<h3>Subject: Reference Letter â€“ Charles Dawson </h3>

<p>I am very pleased to write this letter of reference on behalf of Charles Dawson in my capacity as CFO of Longview, Inc., Longview is a recent start-up Web Services development company that specializes in providing hosting, networking and ancillary services to the corporate sector. Overall, I believe Charles to be a skilled, thoughtful, and thoroughly professional Information Technology expert, which I will briefly elaborate on below. </p>

<p>II have known Charles as one of my key employees for almost three years. I first got to know him when he helped us develop a software system as a Research Assistant in Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois. On that project I was impressed by his initiative and his thirst for knowledge. He also showed strong analytical and problem solving skills. In fact, it was for those qualities that we hired him at Longview, Inc. after his graduation in September, 2015.</p> 

<p>IDuring the almost three years that Charles has worked with me at Longview Inc., I have always been impressed by his outstanding diligence and his high level of technical expertise. Indeed, I have been more than satisfied with our working relationship. During this period, I also had the great pleasure of watching him blossom from a junior software developer into a fully functioning business-oriented Principal Software Architect who played the primary architecture and software management role on some of our company's key projects. I was particularly impressed by the professionalism and technical innovation that Richard demonstrated on our Tandem Network Project. </p>

<p>INot only is Charles highly intelligent; he also is very hard-working. He has tackled every project assigned to him with enthusiasm and competence. He invariably understands exactly what a project is all about from the outset, and how to get it done quickly and effectively. He consistently produces superior quality work, on time, and within budget targets. In my estimation, Charles is a true example of the type of employee that every employer wants: accountable and responsible, with a superior work ethic and a high degree of integrity. 
</p>
<p>In closing, I recommend Charles Dawson very highly for any position in the IT field that involves complexity and creativity, with high quality requirements. He is an exceptionally bright and hardworking person who will do his very best to do an outstanding job for whomever he works. If I may be of further assistant with regard to Charles, please call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx or e-mail me at xxxxxxxxxx. </p>

<p>Sincerely,<p>
